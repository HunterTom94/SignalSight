# SignalSight

## Overview
SignalSight is an innovative real-time signal visualization tool that interfaces with data from various sources such as microcontrollers, Bluetooth devices, and online servers. Designed with a focus on learning and mastering VisPy and PyQt/PySide, this project not only serves as a practical tool for data analysis but also as a platform for exploring advanced Python GUI and visualization libraries.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Utilizes VisPy for high-performance, real-time plotting of streaming data.
- **Multiple Data Source Compatibility**: Capable of interfacing with USB (COM port), Bluetooth, and online server data streams.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Crafted using PyQt/PySide, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Flexibility and Customization**: Adaptable to various types of data signals, offering customizable plot options.
- **Educational Value**: A practical example for those learning VisPy, PyQt, and PySide, demonstrating real-world application.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Set up a basic PyQt/PySide window as the applicationâ€™s GUI.
- [ ] Implement real-time data plotting using VisPy.
- [ ] Create a module for handling data from USB (COM port).
- [ ] Develop a feature to connect and receive data via Bluetooth.
- [ ] Add functionality to connect to and stream data from an online server.
- [ ] Incorporate options for customizing plot appearance and settings.
- [ ] Design a user-friendly interface to control data source selection and visualization settings.
- [ ] Write documentation on how to use and extend SignalSight.
- [ ] (Optional) Add advanced features like data recording or analysis tools.
- [ ] Continuously test and refine the user interface for ease of use.
- [ ] Explore and add more features based on user feedback or personal learning goals.
